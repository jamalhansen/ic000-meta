Hi and welcome to the project. This is the Trello board that we are using to keep track of everyone's solutions.

When you join the project you will have access to the board and your card will be added to the "project start" list.

Once you have a github repository, please add a link to your card and move your card to the "In Progress" list.

As we move forward with the project it your card will progress to the "Code Review" list and finally to the "Done" list.

If you would like to write about your experience, please let me know or post a link to your Google Doc under "Blog your Experience"

Finally, if you find any resources that you found helpful or you think would be helpful for others, please add them to the Resources list

If you have questions, or feedback please feel free to reach out to me or add your question to the Q&A list.

Hope that you have fun!
